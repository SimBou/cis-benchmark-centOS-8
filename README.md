## Note:
Hi all, this is my first time creating a project on GITHUB. Since, this is my first time doing such project, I would like to ask you guys to help me check it out. Feel free to send feedback on what to improve on or add any new features.
 
Do note that function 'no_exist' will take a while due to the number of checks it need to process. 

If you like the script, do leave a star :)
 
## UPDATES:
What's new?
There are options available for the script, from indicating what level you want to audit at and also what categories id you want to exclude.
Also, there is a verbose option -vv where debug file will display all the revelant information  e.g. the function executed in the script.

What's up next?
I will be adding a display function to display the results from the json file.

Update 1.0.0.2
patched up integer expression errors for function uae_cfg and paM_config
